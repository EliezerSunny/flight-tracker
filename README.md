# Flight Tracker Application

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to track the status of a flight by providing a flight number. The app fetches flight data from the AviationStack API and displays key flight details, including departure and arrival cities, flight status, and coordinates of the airports. The application also uses the OpenCage API to get the latitude and longitude of the departure and arrival cities.
